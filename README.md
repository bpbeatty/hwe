The purpose of these images is to provide [community Fedora images](https://github.com/ublue-os/main) with Nvidia. This approach can lead to greater reliability as failures can be caught at the build level instead of the client machine. 

# Deprecation Notice
Fedora 41 is the last version of Fedora with Asus and Surface Images being built. Surface images were never built for F41. Nvidia images will likely be moved to Main. Note, at this time we are not deprecating Surface or Asus kernel caching or akmods building.

## If you'd like to work on this let us know and we will transfer this repo to you!
